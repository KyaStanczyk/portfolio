        <h2 ID="about">About Me</h2>
        <p>I grew up in the small town of Oakfield, WI, and I am currently in my second year at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire. Some of my passions include being outdoors/ taking pictures, spending time with friends and family, cooking, cleaning, and thrifting! Some of my biggest goals at the moment is to find an internship relative to my major, as well as to stay on track to graduate early. </p>
